However, the relative contributions of transcriptional and translational regulation during human cellular differentiation are unclear. Here, we induced forebrain neuronal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and characterized genome-wide RNA and translation levels during neurogenesis. We find that thousands of genes change at the translation level across differentiation without a corresponding change in RNA level. Specifically, we identify mTOR complex 1 signaling as a key driver for elevated translation of translation-related genes in hESCs. In contrast, translational repression in active neurons is mediated by transcript 3′ UTRs, through regulatory sequences. Together, our findings identify a functional role for the dramatic 3′ UTR extensions that occur during brain development, and provide insights to interpret genetic variants in post-transcriptional control factors that influence neurodevelopmental disorders and diseases.'}

To investigate this question, we use a CRISPR/dCas9 based epigenetic editing tool, where an inactive form of Cas9 is fused to DNMT3A and its regulator DNMT3L. Using this system, we show simultaneous de novo DNA methylation of genes commonly methylated in cancer, CDKN2A, RASSF1, HIC1 and PTEN in primary myoepithelial cells isolated from healthy human breast tissue. We find that promoter methylation is maintained in this system, even in the absence of the fusion construct and results in sustained repression of CDKN2A and RASSF1 transcripts which prevents cells from entering senescence. The phenotype is associated with retuned expression of a subset of genes to levels in early passage cells; however, the outgrowing myoepithelial cells are not immortal but proliferate for 18-20 population doublings before cell cycle arrest. Finally, we show that the key driver of this phenotype is repression of CDKN2A transcript p16, but prolonged proliferation is enhanced by combined hypermethylation and repression of both CDKN2A transcripts p16 and p14. This work demonstrates that hit-and-run epigenetic events can prevent senescence entry, a potential first step in the disease process.'}

Using human CDK7 analog-sensitive (CDK7as) cells, we observed reduced capping enzyme recruitment, increased pol II promoter-proximal pausing, and defective termination at gene 3\'-ends upon CDK7 inhibition. We also found that CDK7 regulates chromatin modifications downstream of transcription start sites. H3K4me3 spreading was restricted at gene 5\'-ends and H3K36me3 was displaced toward gene 3\'-ends in CDK7as cells. Together, these results implicate a CDK7-dependent "CTD code" that regulates epigenetic marks in addition to RNA processing and pol II pausing.'}
